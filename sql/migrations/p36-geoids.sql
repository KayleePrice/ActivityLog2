alter table A_TRACKPOINT
  add column geoid integer;

-- NOTE: the latitude, longitude can be recovered from geoid, so we don't need
-- to index those to make it a covering index for elevation correction, saving
-- some space.
create index IX2_A_TRACKPOINT
  on A_TRACKPOINT(geoid, altitude, timestamp);

-- Improve speed of heat map queries
create index IX3_A_TRACKPOINT
  on A_TRACKPOINT(length_id, geoid);
